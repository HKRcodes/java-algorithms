How to Print Pattern in Java
Java pattern program enhances the coding skill, logic, and looping concepts. It is mostly asked in Java interview to check the logic and thinking of the programmer. We can print a Java pattern program in different designs. To learn the pattern program, we must have a deep knowledge of the Java loop, such as for loop do-while loop. In this section, we will learn how to print a pattern in Java.

We have classified the Java pattern program into three categories:

Start Pattern
Number Pattern
Character Pattern
Before moving to the pattern programs, let's see the approach.

Whenever you design logic for a pattern program, first draw that pattern in the blocks, as we have shown in the following image. The figure presents a clear look of the pattern.
public class RightTrianglePattern   
{   
public static void main(String args[])   
{   
//i for rows and j for columns      
//row denotes the number of rows you want to print  
int i, j, row=6;   
//outer loop for rows  
for(i=0; i<row; i++)   
{   
//inner loop for columns  
for(j=0; j<=i; j++)   
{   
//prints stars   
System.out.print("* ");   
}   
//throws the cursor in a new line after printing each line  
System.out.println();   
}   
}   
}
